# School Jammers

Entry for [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com "One Game A Month") June 2013.
Yeah, in November.

And I just decided that it will also be a [Game Boy Jam 2](http://gbjam.net "Game Boy Jam") entry.

I'm going for three days working on it.

## How To Play

You need two players on the same computer.
And a keyboard handling several key strokes simultaneously.

### Controls

Player 1 :

* W/Z Q/A S D : movement / throw direction
* T : throw / charging
* Y : toss / dash

### Rules

Incoming.

* Normal throw
* Dash
* Toss
* Power throw
* Counter power throw

## What ?

I've just discovered Windjammers (Flying Power Disc), a Neo Geo game from 1994.
But I didn't played it yet, I just watched videos and tournaments and stuff.
And I read some description/rules on Wikipedia.

So I don't know what the game is really like.
And I though that it would be fun (for me at least) to "copy" the concept only on my limited knowledge of the game.

So, this is it.
Windjammers in a school.

## Why School ?

Because I wanted to take a theme from One Game A Month and I couldn't find a theme for this idea.
So, I chose the low-brow comprehension of this theme : educational.
