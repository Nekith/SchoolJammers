# School Jammers

Entry for [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com "One Game A Month") June 2013.
Yeah, in November.

And I've decided that it will also be a [Game Boy Jam 2](http://gbjam.net "Game Boy Jam") entry.

## How To Play

You need two players on the same computer.
And a keyboard handling several key strokes simultaneously.
Just try. At least, if you lose, you can blame the keyboard.

### Controls

Player 1 :

* W/Z Q/A S D : movement / throw direction
* T : throw / charging / ok
* Y : toss / dash

Player 2 :

* Up Left Down Right : movement / throw direction
* O/Numpad 7 : throw / charging / ok
* P/Numpad 8 : toss / dash

### Rules

You hit the goal (it's the far-left and far-right zones), you mark 3 points.

You toss the disk and your adversary don't catch it, you mark 2 points.

At 9 points, you win a round.

A 2 rounds, you win the game.

### Moves

If the disk speed is too high, you can be stunned.

If you charge your throw before receiving a toss, you execute a power throw.

If you charge your throw before receiving a power throw, you counter it.

## What ?

I've just discovered Windjammers (Flying Power Disc), a Neo Geo game from 1994.
But I didn't played it yet, I just watched videos and tournaments and stuff.
And I read some description/rules on Wikipedia.

So I don't know what the game is really like.
And I though that it would be fun (for me at least) to "copy" the concept only on my limited knowledge of the game.

So, this is it.
Windjammers in a school.

## Why School ?

Because I wanted to take a theme from One Game A Month and I couldn't find a theme fitting for it.
So, I chose the low-brow comprehension of this theme : educational.
